# AbsenceTracker
School Class Final: Digital way to track student absences in the classroom. This is a demo.

This app was written using the Dart language with the Flutter framework. If you just want to install the app on your device, you can find the apk file at: "build/app/outputs/apk/app.apk".

If working or compiling this project, let it be noted that the file "android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-4.10.2-all.zip" was omitted due to its size. You will probably need this file. :)
